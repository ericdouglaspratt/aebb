## Andy and Eric Bike Boston

In 2017, we decided the perfect way to get to know all of Boston's neighborhoods was to visit every single Blue Bikes station in the area. Tracking our progress and planning routes to unvisited stations became complex, so this project was born!

### Goals

* Visualize our progress towards visiting all the stations
* Provide enough functionality so when on-the-go, we don't have to keep switching between Blue Bikes app, Google Maps, and the website to plan our route
* Allow us to browse past trips
* Show us fun stats using our historical trip data

### Project Features

* Map combines cached station data with live feed to show current station status plus stations we visited that no longer exist
* Green icon means we visited the station (and took a photo), blue icon means unvisited, gray means inactive
* Geolocation shows a blue dot on the map where you are and centers the map, for easy progress tracking on-the-go



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
